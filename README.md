## Abstract

Music recommendation systems play a pivotal role in the digital music industry, significantly enhancing user experience by personalizing music selections. However, the majority of existing systems predominantly focus on leveraging user preferences and song metadata, neglecting the critical influence of contextual information on music choice. Our project, "Context-Aware Music Recommendation System," seeks to bridge this gap by incorporating a variety of contextual factors, such as the userâ€™s emotional state, physical environment, and temporal variables, into the recommendation process.
