## Abstract

Our "Context-Aware Music Recommendation System" enhances traditional music recommendations by incorporating contextual factors such as userâ€™s emotional state, physical environment, and temporal variables. By leveraging Factorization Machines (FMs) and integrating diverse data sources, we improve the relevance and personalization of music recommendations.


## Setup & Running

Run the following set of commands to start the playlist generator:

```bash
cd searching/advanced
python3 gen_playlist.py
```


## Generating a Playlist

There are 4 types of searches that this playlist generator supports

* **Similarity based** : Enter the URI of the query song
* **Dissimilarity based** : Enter the URI of the query song
* **Field based** : Enter the musical feature field followed by <num, #number> or <id, URI> for the song or value with respect to which the playlist is to be generated
* **Mood based** : Enter the mood cluster name *(for eg : mood0)*
